# EventTrackerProject

### Week 12 Homework

## Overview

This is a full-stack Java Spring project based on a Mysql database and implements REST API.

This application allows a user to post their camping experiences to include information such as: 
The campsite's name, description, terrain, and pictures. The user also has the ability to edit their trips that are already in the database or completely delete a posting. 

## Database

* TODO: Screenshot of ER diagram, description of entities

### Lessons Learned

For this project, I learned how crucial it is to come up with a solid plan before beginning your work. There were a few times that I had to change things in my database because the original content didn't work. If I would have spent more time in the planning stage, I would have saved myself time and trouble later on.

I also learned a lot about using Javascript for setting up the front-end for projects.
